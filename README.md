# stellaris-galaxygeneration

This mod lets you generate galaxies differently. There are stars in the center/core.

- 2-arms: big center with 2 Arms spiraling outwards.
  - ideal for Roleplay-Parties, where gamemaster wants 3 groups.
- 4 arms: no center at all, but 4 arms connecting in the center.

Thanx to evil-victor for the shader and background so that gameplay is not obstructed by bad visibility
